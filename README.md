The CyberVets program is hosted through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The program is used to aid in transitioning warfighters to civilian missions that help protect and strengthen our federal IT infrastructure. Its a six-month rotation giving servicemembers the ability to learn the skills required to protect data and networks through "on the job" training.
